# Image Analysis of Benign and Malignant Skin Lesions (DS4002 - Group 14)

The goal of this project is to evaluate whether a deep learning image classification model can accurately distinguish between benign and malignant skin lesions using dermoscopic images. The project utilizes an EfficientNet-B0 backbone with a custom classification head. The study compares binary classification and 11-class classification across image-only and multimodal (image + metadata) architectures.

## Section 3: Instructions for reproducing your results

### 1. Repository Setup

Clone the repository to your local machine or upload the folder structure to your Google Drive for Colab use.
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Ds4002-Group14-Project3.git](https://github.com/your-username/Ds4002-Group14-Project3.git)
cd Ds4002-Group14-Project3
```

### 2. Data Acquisition

Due to file size constraints on GitHub, the raw image files are not hosted in this repository. Follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to `DATA/How_to_Acquire_Images.txt`.
2.  Follow the provided link to the ISIC/MILK10k archive.
3.  Download the image zip file and extract the contents into `DATA/MILK10k_Training_Input/`.

### 3. Environment Preparation

Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision timm pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pillow
```

### 4. Running the Analysis

The scripts are modular and can be run independently depending on the desired experiment. Each notebook contains code to:

1.  Load and merge the CSV metadata from the `DATA` folder.
2.  Perform a 70/15/15 stratified split by `lesion_id` to ensure no images of the same lesion appear in multiple sets.
3.  Initialize the EfficientNet-B0 model with pre-trained weights.
4.  Execute the training loop, featuring a 3-epoch backbone freeze to stabilize the classification head and prevent overfitting.
5.  Generate and save performance plots to the corresponding subfolder in `OUTPUT`.

Open any notebook in the `SCRIPTS` folder and select "Run All" to reproduce the metrics and figures.

### 5. Verification of Results

The reproduction is successful if:

1.  The script generates a `.pth` model checkpoint in the `OUTPUT` directory.
2.  The Validation AUC stabilizes or improves across 20 epochs.
3.  The confusion matrix and training curves are saved as `.png` files in the experiment-specific folder.
